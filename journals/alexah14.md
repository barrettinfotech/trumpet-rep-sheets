### Week 1

### Week 2

### Week 3

### Week 4

I did 12 hours of practice on trumpet last week really digging into some of my possible recital repertoire and fundamental practice. Every session opened with some scale practice, I am still reading my harmonic and melodic minor scales unfortunately but I want to really become proficient at them. I’ve been trying to focus on the fluidity between my notes, as this has been a recent struggle. I also read some jazz music in preparation for jazz ensemble class, shaking some of the dust off. I feel that my practice was efficient, but didn’t feel much improvement in scales or fluidity between notes, especially notes of large partials. 

### Week 5

Log: I practiced about 4 hours of my recital music, spread throughout the week. I practice/warmed up with some Clarke and Arban practice. These were sporadic, I do not remember how much time was spent. I also spent about 2 hours on jazz music prep and practice, getting ready for my coming concert. 

Reflection: I wanted to play a bit more overall, especially towards the end of the week, but unfortunately either couldn’t play for more than an hour and a half or couldn’t play at all. I also would’ve liked to be a bit more productive in my practice but due to an unfortunately poor mental state going in and out I struggled with that. 

Aspirations: I would love to have my “Framed” recital pieces close to ready by April 1st. If I have these two ready soon I can prepare better for the others. I would also like to push myself to work on my melodic/harmonic minor scales no matter how painfully mundane it can be sometimes. 

### Week 6

This week, I didn’t practice as much as I wanted to due to exams and lots of midterm prep and concert prep. I got about 2ish hours of practice on some jazz solo stuff and recital pieces. But honestly it was not very productive practice and I’ve felt a bit of a lull. I have felt improvement but it’s slow going, and when I’m stressed about exams it’s hard to focus on something else. 

I wish I had made more time to practice, but to be honest I kinda hit my highest stress levels this week. Of the practice I did get I do think I’m starting to get the hang of the pieces. 

I hope to get a bit more practice in but next week is another heavy workload week. I want to focus on articulation in my recital pieces and see if I can get a more stable quiet dynamic tone on the horn. It has felt unstable as of late. 

Based on the recording we took of me playing, I need to be more consistent and confident in myself and my sound. It’s there.. I just need to really focus in.&#x20;

### Week 7

### Week 8

I think we’re in week 8. In keeping myself accountable I plan to try and use this instead of my notes app when I practice. 3/20/24 Today I practiced my melodic and harmonic scales, but I’m doing them in chunks. Today I did A, E, B, and F#. I then did the Clarke characteristic study 1 for about 5 minutes, trying to work on smoothness between notes. After a short break I worked on #2 from Brandt’s 34 Etude Book for about 10 minutes. I took an extended break and then took to practice Nocturne in Blue and Gold, trying to really focus on breaking it down and focusing in on articulation neatness.&#x20;

Final Rep List for Recital:

Duet piece with Brenna


3/21/24 Today I practiced for 2 hours and then also had jazz band. During my practice session, I practiced the Clarke Characteristic Study 1, focusing on articulation and stamina. I also ran through the first part of A Crab A Quill, going back to spots I flubbed. I took an extended break and then came back to finish out the sesh with some flexibility exercises in the packet.&#x20;
