I think we’re in week 8. In keeping myself accountable I plan to try and use this instead of my notes app when I practice. 3/20/24 Today I practiced my melodic and harmonic scales, but I’m doing them in chunks. Today I did A, E, B, and F#. I then did the Clarke characteristic study 1 for about 5 minutes, trying to work on smoothness between notes. After a short break I worked on #2 from Brandt’s 34 Etude Book for about 10 minutes. I took an extended break and then took to practice Nocturne in Blue and Gold, trying to really focus on breaking it down and focusing in on articulation neatness.&#x20;
