## Lesson Notes

## week 12



Good job on your whirlwind proficiency adventure today, Alexa. Your range, tone, articulation and knowledge of scales are NOTABLY better these days!

Work on Bordogni Transposition etude #1, and pick out a new etude (are there any by female composers?)





### Week 3

brainstorming for recital rep

1. songs by F. Price or M. Bonds from the anthology--theme might be visual things represented in music
2. A Crab,,
3. Preussen, 2nd sonata (piccolo trumpet)
4. Claude Arrieu, Reverie
5. Cecelia McDowel, "Framed" stuff

Welcome back to studio Alexa! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

## week 2 (first week of lessons)

Send me sheet music (PDF) of the pieces you want to play for your recital.

Work on Boehme #2 in a minor--pay attention to rhythmic subdivistions!!
