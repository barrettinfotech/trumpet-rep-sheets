## Lesson Notes

## week 5

Goedicke--work toward making a rich and wonderful tone every note. Direction is important. All of this while trying to tackle the technical difficulties. Don't forget to work on lip flexibility for this piece.

Welcome back to studio Arjen! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

Hi Arjen! Love your Goedicke concerto choice. Great piece and great for you. Review the Martinu--it may become a good choice for a competition like NTC or ITG. 

Pick a Charlier and live with that for a good while to become great at it. 

Keep working on your top 5 excerpts, and add Mahler 1 for next week

## Week 2

Good job on Pines of Rome. Work slow with metronome. Practice articulations off trumpet to save chops. Connect a bit more on last movement
Next week, solo and/or etude, please
