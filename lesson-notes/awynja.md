# Dr. Curtis' feedback for Arjen

# Spring 2024

week6

Mahler--maybe a bit longer on some notes, because tpt can't do some consonants in the way vocalists do--so we need to play in general more connectedly.&#x20;

Taps--great!

Torelli--connecting between slurred pairs of 16ths.



Week 5

Torelli: redefine hemiolas; consistent time (not late finishing trills); clarity.&#x20;

Look up performance certificate details from other comparable schools of music

Good work on Mahler 5. We talked about hierarchical dynamics. Tuning problems toward the end (play the concert Eb a little lower)

## Week 1

Etudes: Bousquet--good for sight reading. Also do Charlier #1

Solos, Torelli, Concerto in D; Mahler, Song of a Wayfarer; Pictures for tpt & piano or organ?

Torelli: style--8th note pairs, second one softer. Stepwise motion smooth, but disjunct motion crisper. Keep in mind the hierarchy needs of the meter--think about agogic accents. When 16ths up down repeated figure--slur 2 by 2.&#x20;

Week 13

Brahm Academic better! Make smoother phrasing. Keep in tempo. Last notes of phrases not cut too short.&#x20;

Goedicke: cadenza--work to polish. 10 and 13 bigger and more organic in slow down. keep trills moving.&#x20;

## Week 12&#x20;

Hi Arjen, great lesson. Please DO work hard on the NRO audition materials. We worked a bit on the Brahms Academic Festival Overture. Work for a smooth, non-vibrato way of playing. Dark tone. Good phrasing, consistent articulation for beginning of notes.&#x20;
