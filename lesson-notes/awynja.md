# Dr. Curtis' feedback for Arjen

Week 13

Brahm Academic better! Make smoother phrasing. Keep in tempo. Last notes of phrases not cut too short.&#x20;

Goedicke: cadenza--work to polish. 10 and 13 bigger and more organic in slow down. keep trills moving.&#x20;



## Week 12&#x20;

Hi Arjen, great lesson. Please DO work hard on the NRO audition materials. We worked a bit on the Brahms Academic Festival Overture. Work for a smooth, non-vibrato way of playing. Dark tone. Good phrasing, consistent articulation for beginning of notes.&#x20;
