# Dr. Curtis' feedback for Arjen

## Week 12&#x20;

Hi Arjen, great lesson. Please DO work hard on the NRO audition materials. We worked a bit on the Brahms Academic Festival Overture. Work for a smooth, non-vibrato way of playing. Dark tone. Good phrasing, consistent articulation for beginning of notes.&#x20;
