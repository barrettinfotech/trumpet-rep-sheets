## week 5

Ryan, all sounding good. Make sure you work on your jury piece. Are you going to commit to the Balay "Petite Piece Concertante?"

### week 3

Peri--more tone on shorter notes. Find notes in the scale. Full value all the way to end of notes.

Concone in a minor, great job!!!!

Look at Gatti etude in G major--not too short on short notes.

Start looking at Balay, Petite Piece Concertante

## week 2

Clarke 5 with one breath every two lines. We played at 70 for the 8th note--incrementally work up from there.

pick out etude from Gatti--E minor

Welcome back to studio Ryan! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

Hi Ryan--lots of progress since last year! Try working on Clarke 5 with minimal or no embouchure re-sets.
