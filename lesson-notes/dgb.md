## Lesson Notes

Spring 2024

week 2

Bach/Gisondi #13. Worked on breathing place

## week 13

Drew, good lesson checking proficiencies off. Please keep going with the various assignments in Canvas as you have time over the next little while. I'm not too worried about the Turrin--it'll be great. Work also on the correct transposition for Scheherazade orch part, and, work on a couple of new etudes from the Sachse Book for transposition (you have about 10 of these in your proficiency packet--they look kind of gray (we did a couple today, one in Bb and one in A).&#x20;

# week 12

Caprice: upper range flex using lip trills (try with vowel placement movement only). Try setting for higher note when phrase starts low and goes high.&#x20;

Shuebruk lip trainers for attack drills to help get more notes.&#x20;

Phrasing--tailor to suit you sometimes---Stan likes phrasing that can be independent of the note beginnings and ends.&#x20;

Be able to do legato type of tonguing on the fly (see letter D in Caprice)

## week 5

Good work on Turrin. We explored using smooth but full air to help phrase the main theme. We tried to avoid footballing too much or to have gaps in the line. I ordered the Turring so that we can have an accompaniment and a C tpt part (but see if you can get a working version of the C tpt part while we're waiting). I wouldn't mind hearing the de Luca if you want to play that next lesson

## week 3

Good on Top Tones range--keep relaxed, scan for excess tension when possible, keep soft.
Wagner--try with BERP and drone. Think resonance. Especially from the head.

Stephenson Concerto 1

Welcome to studio Drew! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

Hi Drew--dusting off the Intrada is a great idea for you! next week will pick up where we left off.

## week 2

Good job on Intrada in studio! Work to even out triple tongue and make linear phrases. Work on Proficiency handout. Beethoven Leonore 3, keep going on this. Bizet Carmen Suite. Charlier 6.
