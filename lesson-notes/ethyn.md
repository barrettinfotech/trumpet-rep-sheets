## Lesson Notes

## week 3

Clarke 1 sounding very good when you play with a relatively slow met speed (today it was at 100 for quarter). I like your controlled dynamic (soft). 
Work on Major scales and single tongue proficiencies.
Bordogni 1--record. 2, work on singing then mouthpiece--use drone or recording as sound reference (or piano)
Hansen--play along with recording at slower speed.

### Ethyn, good job. 

Welcome to studio Ethyn! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

Work on Clarke 1st study--at least the first page (chromatic)

Then work on all major scales. All two octaves. 

Work on Bordogni etude 1 (in D major)

## week 2
Good job on Bordogni. Work on slur studies (Irons or Bai Lin). Try focusing on just 123, 12, 0 combinations if you want to go fast throught the study. Consider alternating playing on tpt and then on mouthpiece--integrate the two into a great slur

Clarke 1--great job. Work with metronome for an incrementally faster (but still clean) ability 

Bordogni 1 was great! Try Bordogni 2 (or you can pick out a different etude from your rep sheet. 

Start learning and listening to Hansen Sonata
