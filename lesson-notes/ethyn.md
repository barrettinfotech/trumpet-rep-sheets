## Lesson Notes

week 13

Ethyn super terrific job with the SmartMusic app helping you learn your Scarlatti Suite! A couple of things to remember:

1\. make sure you're counting correcting. Less info can be helpful. don't wait too long after dotted quarter

2\. when the arrangement calls for 4 notes to be slurred together, try to do that (instead of 2 by 2)

3\. trill should start on downbeat and starts on the note above the printed note.&#x20;

4\. keep steady rhythm when piano drops out (2 before first ending)

5\. good dynamic contrasts!

6\. "Play-ing"

## week 6

Ethyn, you're doing great. The place to work for the most growth is in rhythm and reading. Try to play duets and excerpts with as many fellow students as possible.

## week 3

Clarke 1 sounding very good when you play with a relatively slow met speed (today it was at 100 for quarter). I like your controlled dynamic (soft).
Work on Major scales and single tongue proficiencies.
Bordogni 1--record. 2, work on singing then mouthpiece--use drone or recording as sound reference (or piano)
Hansen--play along with recording at slower speed.

### Ethyn, good job.

Welcome to studio Ethyn! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

Work on Clarke 1st study--at least the first page (chromatic)

Then work on all major scales. All two octaves.

Work on Bordogni etude 1 (in D major)

## week 2

Good job on Bordogni. Work on slur studies (Irons or Bai Lin). Try focusing on just 123, 12, 0 combinations if you want to go fast throught the study. Consider alternating playing on tpt and then on mouthpiece--integrate the two into a great slur

Clarke 1--great job. Work with metronome for an incrementally faster (but still clean) ability

Bordogni 1 was great! Try Bordogni 2 (or you can pick out a different etude from your rep sheet.

Start learning and listening to Hansen Sonata
