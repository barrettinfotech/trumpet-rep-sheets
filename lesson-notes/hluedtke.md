## Lesson Notes

# Spring 2024

### week 5

etudes: Snedecor 4

solos: Invocation, Timberline

Excerpts: Mahler 5. Work toward very even and single-tongue-sounding articulation for opening triplets. Compress these triplets (as in a 6/4 bar).&#x20;

### week 3

Llewellyn, we worked hard on pitch stability in the trio with slow slurs and with mouthpiece. Tone is king here!!!

Welcome back to studio Hunter! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

Hi Hunter--the Llewellyn is a great choice for one of your solo pieces this semester. Also work on Charlier 1, and pick another etude for next week.

Good work on Charlier 1--keep working light tonguing with metronome work.
