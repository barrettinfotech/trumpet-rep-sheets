## Lesson Notes

Welcome to studio Mason! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

Hi Mason--just a reminder to work on Clarke Technical Studies! Pick some good repertoire possibilities (etudes, excerpts, solos).

## August 28

Gibbons Suite (for baroque)
Haydn concerto
Bernstein, Rondo for Lifey

Keep working on CTS Study 1 with articulations (K, T, TT, DT, Slur)

Gibbons: keep tongue light and smooth--air and fluidity important here. Use met for Corante (end trills on time)
