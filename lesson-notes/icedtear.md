Etudes





## Lesson Notes

## week 12

Working on the Scriabin. We made progress on:

1\. projecting a nice tone all the way to the back of ORH

2\. Steady flow of dynamics

3\. Quality control

4\. if doing rit. use bell like a conductor's baton

5\. breathing is important--try to plan your breaths for ease of playing at end of phrases

## week 7

Worked slurs--"stretching" to get a slur without gaps. Work with the Irons 27 Groups book to get better and better!
We worked on the Bordogni # 2. We isolated the major 6th interval. Then we played in context until better. We talked about the 4 main ways to practice: repetition, metronome (incrementally increasing speed until arriving at a target speed), isolation of hard passages, and quality control.
Next lesson, finish Bordogni 2. Hansen. And start tackling an excerpt. Keep passing off proficiencies with Will. thanks!! good work!

## week 6

Bryce--coming along really well. Try to focus on tone, embouchure stability and reading. Get together with others in studio to read duets.

## week 5

Good work towards developing a more stable and horizontal approach to lyrical playing. We tried 2 melodies out of the 1st book by Tabakov. The "method" we used was to play on trumpet first, then on mouthpiece, then back on trumpet.

## week 4 (group lesson)

## week 3

Work on Scriabin--maybe as if you're doing a jazz transcription. Listen for a bar, then play back. Continue that way to the end.
