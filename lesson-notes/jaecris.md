## Lesson Notes

## week 6

Juniper--I'm proud of your progress. Hang in there. Read duets with as many in studio as possible.

### week 3

Good job, Juniper! for the Bordogni 1, you're sounding much better, but try to sing this piece. Then buzz it. Use a pitch reference to keep you on pitch. 
Keep working on major scales (1 octave for now, but soon expand to 2 octaves when possible--1 octave + 5 notes when it's too high). 

I'd like to hear another piece or two when I get back--in the week of the 18th. 



Welcome to studio Juniper! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

## week 2

Free buzzing, 

Also Bordogni #1--good for now. Work on Bordogni #2 after you record #1 for Canvas

Work on proficiency packet--do the Clarke Technical Study #1 (chromatic) and all major scales one octave. 

Explore your rep sheet (both level 9 and level 8) to find pieces that are interesting for you. You'll need 4 etudes (the first will be the Bordogni #1). Three excerpts (either band or orchestra). Two "contrasting" solos--they should feel different or come from different time periods. You'll have to record all of these and upload your video recording links onto canvas throughout the semester. One of the solos will be for your jury. Typically, the jury will solo will have piano accompaniment. You'll start working with a staff pianist around end of November. Juries will be on the Monday of Finals Week and you'll have to pick a time (there will be an email that asks you to pick). You'll coordinate and communicate with the staff pianist to rehearse the piece. You'll also play with the staff pianist in your lesson at least once or maybe up to a few times. 
You're going to do great!
