## week 6

Kris, you're doing great. In working with your double buzz issue, try to not rest too much--this can send you into a tailspin of other issues. Consistent practice/lip time is important. Work on control of the double buzz rather than just elimination--in this way you'll be able to work with problems as they arise.

## week 5

We worked on Jolivet--try smoothing up the articulation. Work on Hembree and Clarke 1 for triple tongue. Use mouthpiece to allow the lips to do some of the pitch changing (as opposed to relying too much on the vowel placememnt of the tongue to change pitch. If too reliant on vowel placement, then it's really hard to multiple tongue in extreme or quickly changing registers.

Look at sticky valves when you get a chance.

Try out your newly added solo repertoire. Maybe bring in Rachmaninoff soon.

Welcome back to studio Kris! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

Good week 1 lesson yeah!
