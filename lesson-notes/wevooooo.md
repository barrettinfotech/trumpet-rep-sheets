# Spring 2024

Week 6

good work on Latham Suite--practice gradually for more speed in 3rd movement! Really connect slurs in 2nd mvt!



Week 5

talked about mutes--play louder and more in the center.

## Week 1

Talked about how to start journaling your practice.

Brandt, Etude 1, 2, 3, 4 (record 1)

Solos: Latham Suite; McKee Amazing Grace

Excerpts: Copland, Rodeo, "Hoe Down," Ives, Variations on America; Persichetti, "Divertimento"&#x20;

## Lesson Notes

Gradual and beginning-like work on Charlier 3. We brought tempos way down to get more right notes. We also worked a bit on Clarke Study 7, supplemental work on the diminished 7th arpeggio. For next week, polish what we had worked on (roughly the 1st page). Also read through several times the rest of this etude.

We only had a bit of time to work more on the Riisager. Continue to work on a Goldilocks (or Baby Bear) tempo, so that quality playing is in your focus.

You need to check off your proficiencies. You also need to submit videos of Canvas stuff.

## week 3

practice harmonic and melodic minor scales for 2 octaves
Riisager. Practice more to more comfortable with notes. Articulation should balance more toward fluid air-driven beginnings to notes (rather than tongue-driven)

Welcome back to studio Trevor! I'll add your lesson notes here throughout the semester.

## week 2

Riisager--working slowly with met. Go for smooth, elegant style,
Riisager mvt 2 next week

Charlier 3--keep working listen to Hakan Hardenberger play this.
