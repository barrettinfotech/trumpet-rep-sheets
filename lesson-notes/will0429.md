## Lesson Notes

# Spring 2024

## Week 1

keep journal going.&#x20;

Etudes: Charlier starting with 23 (but review earlier ones--maybe 2 a week)





## 6th week

we worked hard on Saint Saens. Keep tongue light, keep soft when possible and when it helps musically. Accents from the breath not from tongue. Keep sneaking up gradually on your target tempos. Work with "quality control" practice techniques.

## 2nd week

Hi Will--Saint Saens sounds great. organize with the competition deadline in mind! Work on technique in general at a bit higher level

## 1st week

Hi Will! Work on the transposing Bordogni #2 for next week. Also bring in the Saint-Saens.
