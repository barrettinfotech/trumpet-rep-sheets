## Lesson Notes

## week 12

Good work on the BÃ¶hme, Dylan. We got through it. AND with metronome which is a great accomplishment. KEEP working on this. Try at least one hour a day (and two if you have time) in addition to all the other things you're doing on the trumpet.&#x20;

## week 6

Dylan, try to committ to your solo rep by this point in the semester. Work consistently on your chosen stuff. 3 hours of practice every day would be ideal--but make sure much of that is soft playing (like Clarke!).

### week 3

warmup good--make sure you're doing good mouthpiece buzzing. Focus also on soft playing in general and on breath attacks.
Gershwin not too loud. Keep tone going through slurs and vibrato not too slow.

## week 2

working with met on Bach. Eighth at 68 is pretty good for now. Inch closer to goal tempos slowly.
Start working on Allemande
Petrouchka--1 breath
pick out a different etude to play for your Canvas recording

## week 1

Hi Dyan--working on Petrouchka. Commit to one breath. Bach Cello Suite. How about a standard etude?
