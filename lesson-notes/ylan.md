warmup good--make sure you're doing good mouthpiece buzzing. Focus also on soft playing in general and on breath attacks. 
Gershwin not too loud. Keep tone going through slurs and vibrato not too slow.

working with met on Bach. Eighth at 68 is pretty good for now. Inch closer to goal tempos slowly.

pick out a different etude to play for your Canvas recording
